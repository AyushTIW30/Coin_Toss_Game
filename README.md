# Coin Toss Game

Welcome to the Coin Toss Game! This is a simple, interactive Python game where the user can predict the outcome of a coin flip. The game will randomly generate either "Head" or "Tail" and compare it with the user's prediction. It's a fun way to test your luck! ðŸŽ²

---

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: The game asks the player to predict whether the coin will land on heads or tails.
- **Random Coin Toss**: The game simulates a coin toss using Python's `random.choice()` to choose randomly between "Head" and "Tail".
- **Personalized Experience**: The game greets the user by name and provides feedback on whether the prediction was correct.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the user provides a valid prediction ("Head" or "Tail").
